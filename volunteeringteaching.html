            <h2>Engineering Education for Middle School, High School, and Undergraduate Students in Underrepresented Communities and Developing Nations</h2>
            <img src="images/ghana.jpg" alt="Global Code 2018">
            <p>
                I worked with <b><a href="http://www.elite-education.org/">E.L.i.T.E.</a></b> based in Harlem, NYC and <b><a href="https://globalcode.org.uk/">Global Code</a></b> based in Accra, Ghana to develop curriculum, structure learning, 
				assist in hands-on material, and teach classroom lectures. Depending on the level of education (Middle/High/Undergraduate), the 
				engineering material was tailored to beginner, intermediate, or advanced exposure. As an example, beginner level would be exposed to 
				engineering principles integrated math, physics, and applied technology to create basic programs teaching students to translate their coursework
				to real life user experience. The advanced level would involve creating applications to provide solutions for real world problems often programming 
				Raspberry Pis/Arduinos paired with circuitry/robotics and larger engineered prototypes.

            <h2>University Teaching Assistant</h2>
            <p>
                During my graduate studies, I served as a teaching assistant for a graduate genomics course. This involved teaching lectures, 
				grading papers and assignments, hosting office hours, and providing access to discuss interests in the field of genomics. 
				I also had the opportunity to curate and lead several workshops such as an <b><a href="https://bootcamp.biostars.io/">annual data reproducibility bootcamp</a></b> focused on providing 
				hands-on guidance and material in fundamental/advanced techniques to improve productivity, rigor, and reproducibility in software/analytic 
				development in the research and development setting.

            <p>
                As a volunteer mentor, I guided middle school, high school, and undergraduate students through their professional development in pursuit of higher education.
				I participated in several programs such as the <b><a href="https://prescientist.org/">Letters to a Pre-Scientist</a></b> (highly recommend) and CUNY mentorship programs. I believe its important to share lessons learned
				through your path to help others seeking advice or displaying interest.

            <h2>Genomix Graduate Student Leadership</h2>
            <img src="images/ccbb.jpg" alt="Work in Progress CCBB Conference at PSU">
            <p>
                I am the student representative of the bioinformatics graduate department through my active role as the president and board member of Genomix.
                Genomix is a student run graduate organization focused on representing the bioinformatics and genomics community at Penn State University. It's focused
                on integrating students across the university whose interest is in genomic analyses providing consulting, student development, outreach, and community.
                In my time as Genomix president thus far, I have grown the club from 50 individuals to 180 through content generation, public presentations, social gatherings,
                etc. With the help of my board members, I led our team to develop graduate school guides/resources to help take away stress across the timeline of a students graduate
                studies. This can be found <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vWa8I7ItYKft7LCG62TSaILkHR98dQtX?usp=sharing">here</a></b>. I also helped to organize and participate in work in progress conferences designed to encourage different perspectives
                across the community, but also provide a platform to discuss work in progress across the university for computational biology/bioinformatic research. This included a panel
                of biologists and practitioners who shared their experiences using methods and fielded questions from the community of method developers encouraging a bridge to facilitate 
                closing gaps in user experience and needs in meaningful biological analytic method development.
